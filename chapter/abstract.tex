 Using molecular dynamics soft package LAMMPS, we investiage the procedures of compression and shearing of Polymer Nano-sized-fillers Composits (PNCs) based on well parameterized coarsed-grained model. The addition of the nano-sized fillers to the polymer matrix reinforced the mechanical properies of the system. Interestingly, at above or beneath the glass transition temperature, it behaves independent responses to the coppression or the shearing, and the mechanism behind these phenomena are different. The further analysis of Radius Distribution Function (RDF), and the change of the contacting number between polymer and filler, suggest that the reinforcement of the mechanical properties depends on various factors, such as the size and the shape of the filler, the strength of the interaction between polymer and filler, and etc..
