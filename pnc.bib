abstract = {We study the influence of spherical, triangular, and rod-like nanoparticles on the mechanical properties of a polymer nanocomposite (PNC), via coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on how the nanoparticle size, loading, mass, and shape influence the PNC's elastic modulus, stress at failure and resistance against cavity formation and growth, under external stress. We find that in the regime of strong polymer-nanoparticle interactions, the formation of a polymer network via temporary polymer-nanoparticle crosslinks has a predominant role on the PNC reinforcement. Spherical nanoparticles, whose size is comparable to that of the polymer monomers, are more effective at toughening the PNC than larger spherical particles. When comparing particles of spherical, triangular, and rod-like geometries, the rod-like nanoparticles emerge as the best PNC toughening agents.},

@article{Balazs2006,
abstract = {The mixing of polymers and nanoparticles is opening pathways for engineering flexible composites that exhibit advantageous electrical, optical, or mechanical properties. Recent advances reveal routes to exploit both enthalpic and entropic interactions so as to direct the spatial distribution of nanoparticles and thereby control the macroscopic performance of the material. For example, by tailoring the particle coating and size, researchers have created self-healing materials for improved sustainability and self-corralling rods for photovoltaic applications. A challenge for future studies is to create hierarchically structured composites in which each sublayer contributes a distinct function to yield a mechanically integrated, multifunctional material.},

@article{Liu2011a,
abstract = {By employing an idealized model of a polymer network and filler, we have investigated the stress-strain behavior by tuning the filler loading and polymer-filler interaction in a broad range. The simulated results indicate that there actually exists an optimal filler volume fraction (between 23\% and 32\%) for elastomer reinforcement with attractive polymer-filler interaction. To realize this reinforcement, the rubber-filler interaction should be slightly stronger than the rubber-rubber interaction, while excessive chemical couplings are harmful to mechanical properties. Meanwhile, our simulated results qualitatively reproduce the experimental data of Bokobza. By introducing enough chemical coupling between the rubber and the filler, an upturn in the modulus at large deformation is observed in the Mooney-Rivlin plot, attributed to the limited chain extensibility at large deformation. Particularly, the filler dispersion state in the polymer networks is also characterized in detail. It is the first demonstration via simulation that the reinforcement mechanism stems from the nanoparticle-induced chain alignment and orientation, as well as the limited extensibility of chain bridges formed between neighboring nanoparticles at large deformation. The former is influenced by the filler amount, filler size and filler-rubber interaction, and the latter becomes more obvious by strengthening the physical and chemical interactions between the rubber and the filler. Remarkably, the reason for no obvious reinforcing effect in filled glassy or semi-crystalline matrices is also demonstrated. It is expected that this preliminary study of nanoparticle-induced mechanical reinforcement will provide a solid basis for further insightful investigation of polymer reinforcement.},
